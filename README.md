# Metal Renegades

A harsh desert world, where the historic west and modern robots combine.

This is a WIP implementation of the gameplay presented in [this forum post](https://forum.terasology.org/threads/metal-renegades-wild-west-meets-robots.1079/), by Wabadump & AndyTechGuy for GSOC 2019.

## How To Play

Download the Metal Renegades module. When this is installed, create a new world with the Metal Renegades template. If it worked, you should spawn inside a new world that looks like a desert.

## Current Features

### City Generation

When travelling through the world, cities will generate in the world. These cities contain a variety of buildings, including regular homes, marketplaces, churches, etc.

It is also possible to see the citizens of the town roaming about. They are found most frequently inside houses, but can be found out and about all throughout the town.

### Wild Animals & Weapons

Outside of the city, deer can be found roaming about. With the provided weaponry; the pistol and gatling gun, these characters can be killed for their meat.
